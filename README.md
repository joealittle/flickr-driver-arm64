# BBC Box Flickr Driver

This driver will authenticate with Flickr and return a list of URL's for the authenticated user's photos, both public and private. It has been designed to run on BBC Box/Databox.

## Uploading to Box
Upload the databox manifest file to BBC Box in the Settings menu of the App Store. The flickr-driver app should appear in the app store and can then be installed which will pull from Docker Hub.

Docker Hub is configured to automatically build when this repo is updated.
